string art generator

This project is based on the work of @halfmonty from: https://github.com/halfmonty/StringArtGenerator

It is necessary to choose a picture without strong contrast (or only with simple lines), and you may need to do some PhotoShop work beforehand to avoid blank space.

Although it use genetic algorithm, I'm not sure wether it is worth or not since it make barely no difference

## Usage
```sh
cargo run -- --help
```

## TODO

- [X] add a CI
