# StringArtGenerator

string art generator

This project is based on the work of @halfmonty from: https://github.com/halfmonty/StringArtGenerator

It is necessary to choose a picture without strong contrast (or only with simple lines), and you may need to do some PhotoShop work beforehand to avoid blank space.

## Usage
```sh
./StringArt.exe ./Path/to/Your/picture.png > result.txt
```

## TODO

- [] add a CI
