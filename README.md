# StringArtGenerator

string art generator

This project is based on the work of @halfmonty from: https://github.com/halfmonty/StringArtGenerator

It is necessary to choose a picture without strong contrast (or only with simple lines), and you may need to do some PhotoShop work beforehand to avoid blank space.

## Usage
```sh
cargo run -- --help
```

## TODO

- [X] add a CI
